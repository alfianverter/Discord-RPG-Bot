# Discord-RPG-Bot
A simple bot written in Discord.js.
Our prefix is "##".

# ##start
Starts the game.
# attack (No missing.)
When in a game, this will attack the enemy.
# heal
Command not done yet, expect some glitches with it.
# fireball (90% miss chance)
Shoots a fireball that does no damage, but every round the enemy loses 5 HP after you shoot it. Stacks now!
# shield
Blocks all but 0.5 damage from the enemy. At the moment this can be used with Fireball to cheese.
# More to come!
